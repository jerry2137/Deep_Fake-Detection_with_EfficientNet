# Deep Fake Detection with EfficientNet
This project fine-tuned a pretrained model to detect deep fake images.
"deepfake_detection.ipynb" is the training code.
"deepfake_detection_testing.ipynb" is the testing code.
"Final Project.ipynb" is the final report including comparisons between our project and other projects, and some visaulizations.

We also used Explainable AI techniques to interpret how the model classifies the images.
[Key features of this image](sample.png)
In the above images, it is classified as a fake image because of his right side of the face.

More detailed examples are shown in "Final Project.ipynb"
